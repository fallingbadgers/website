            <h3 class="c-page-section__subheading">Overview</h3>

            <p>One Team Government brings together UK policymakers, service designers, digital professionals and cross-sector experts to talk openly and creatively about making government in the UK more effective by working together.  </p>
            <p>We call this 'one team government'. It’s the idea that by bringing teams together to work in a truly multidisciplinary way, we can:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>offer better services to the public </li>
              <li>give better advice to ministers </li>
              <li>make the civil service more effective and efficient</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The event is jointly sponsored by the Civil Service digital and policy professions. It’s being run by a cross-disciplinary team of policy and digital professionals from many departments, who were inspired by <a href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/24/dont-bring-policy-and-delivery-closer-together-make-them-the-same-thing/">this blog post by a senior policy advisor</a> on bringing policy and delivery closer together. </p>

            <p>The event also has the backing of Jeremy Heywood as part of his vision of a Brilliant Civil Service.</p>

            <h3 class="c-page-section__subheading">Why are we doing this?</h3>

            <p>The civil service is united by its values of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality, but different professions are still divided in their skill sets and ways of working.</p>
            <p> We want to bring together professionals who don't currently work seamlessly, to share and create specific ideas about how to work better together. Policy making and digital are our starting points but we’re not limited to these and welcome professionals from across government.</p>

            <p><strong>Our aim is to:</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>introduce different professions to one another's ways of working and increase the empathy between them</li>
              <li>share real, practical case studies of multidisciplinary working and celebrate its benefits</li>
              <li>talk about what holds back one team working and create new ideas of how we can work better together</li>
              <li>hear from teams that are making it work, both inside and outside government</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="c-page-section__subheading">The event is an unconference</h3>

            <p>This means there is no pre-set agenda; attendees will create the agenda themselves on the day, through a series of pitches made at the beginning. <a href="https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/09/the-joys-of-unconferencing/">Clare Moriarty, the Permanent Secretary at Defra, has blogged</a> about the joys of unconferencing.</p>

            <p>There will be 4 time slots through the day, with parallel sessions run in each time slot. Attendees are free to go to whichever sessions they're most interested in. The sessions are likely to be a mixture of case studies, open discussions and workshops.</p>

            <h4 class="c-page-section__subheading">I've never been to an unconference before - how do I know what subjects to expect or pitch?</h4>

            <p>We know some people might be nervous about the unconference approach. So, to give you a flavour of the day, we've done a bit of research into the sessions people would like to either pitch or hear.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/1 u-1/2@large">

            <h3 class="c-page-section__subheading"><strong>The most popular ideas were:</strong></h3>

            <ul>
              <li>creating the right team structure for a ‘one team’ approach</li>
              <li>how to advise ministers when you're working iteratively</li>
              <li>what is policy making? What is digital? What is service design?</li>
              <li>how to 'do governance' better</li>
              <li>how we build cross-profession networks so we all get better together</li>
              <li>bringing policy making, digital and delivery into an end to end approach</li>
              <li>who is doing 'the agile thing' at scale, and how?</li>
              <li>practical ways of bringing policy and delivery together</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The list is just a sample. On the day people might pitch all or none of those ideas - it’s up to everyone attending to decide what’s most important to them.</p>

I’ve only been in the digital/service design space since 2013 - I was a policymaker for a decade until I decided that I wanted a career at the intersection of digital, user-centred design and open policymaking.</p>

            <p>I work in the Policy Lab, a small unit in Cabinet Office that helps civil servants use design, data and digital approaches in their policy-making. I’m a policy-maker who’s learnt design through doing: leading projects with DfE, Defra, MoJ amongst others. I’m constantly in awe of the people I work with: the expert civil servants who know absolutely everything about their niche (often obscure) policy areas; the designers who can turn abstract concepts into real things to prototype; the film ethnographers in my team who communicate the reality of people’s lives so brilliantly. </p>

Before my role at Doteveryone I spent 15 years working as a strategic designer in public services and civic innovation with organisations like Participle, thinkpublic, Government Digital Service and the Co-op. I’m particularly interested in programmes like Systems Changers, where insights from frontline workers could inform policy in real-time. </p>

I’ve been in digital government since 2012, and before that I was a policy maker.
